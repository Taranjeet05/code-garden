        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p>I am deeply passionate about the world of technology 
          and innovation. Beyond web development, I enjoy exploring 
          new programming languages, frameworks, and tools to expand 
          my skills. Iâ€™m particularly interested in artificial 
          intelligence, data science, and cloud computing, and how 
          they intersect with web development to tackle real-world 
          challenges. Outside of tech, I like to dive into 
          geopolitics, history, and geography, as well as modern 
          science. I also enjoy playing strategy games and taking 
          on creative projects that encourage collaboration and 
          out-of-the-box thinking.</p>
