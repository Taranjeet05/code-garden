Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. With Docker, developers can create, test, and deploy applications in isolated environments. 🔧

Portable: Docker containers can run on any system, making your apps highly portable. 🌍

Consistent Environments: Ensure that your app runs consistently across different development, staging, and production environments. 🛠️

Faster Deployment: Reduce the time it takes to deploy applications, as Docker images can be shared and reused. ⏱️
